# Introduction

Toronto, often referred to as a cultural mosaic, is home to a diverse population with roots from all around the world. It is also city where its neighbourhoods vary significantly in income, educational attainment, and demographic makeup. The allocation of capital funding plays an important role in shaping the infrastructure and services available to residents. This impacts their quality of life and access to opportunities.

Despite the importance of equitable funding, there is evidence that budget distributions may not align with the needs of different communities. \[Write about these two:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186789/ , http://neighbourhoodchange.ca/documents/2016/05/walks-etal-2016-income-inequality-toronto-york-rp-238.pdf\]

By analyzing data from the City of Toronto's Capital Budget & Plan, as well as its Ward Profiles, this research finds disparities in per capita funding among the 25 wards. The findings indicate that higher-income wards tend to receive more funding per capita than lower-income wards.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec-data} describes the data sources and methodology used in the analysis. Section \ref{sec-results} presents the results, highlighting key findings. Section \ref{sec-discussion} discussed the implications of the findings as well as limitations and recommendations for next steps.
