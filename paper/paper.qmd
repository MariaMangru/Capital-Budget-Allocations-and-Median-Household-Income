abstract: "This research examines the allocation of capital funding across Toronto's 25 wards from 2022 to 2031, examining its relationship with socioeconomic indicators. The results reveal significant disparities in per capita funding, with higher-income wards and those with higher educational attainment receiving disproportionately more investment. Conversely, wards with higher proportions of low-income households and visible minority populations receive less funding per capita."

# Introduction

Toronto, often referred to as a cultural mosaic, is home to a diverse population with roots from all around the world. It is also city where its neighbourhoods vary significantly in income, educational attainment, and demographic makeup. The allocation of capital funding plays an important role in shaping the infrastructure and services available to residents. This impacts their quality of life and access to opportunities.

Despite the importance of equitable funding, there is evidence that budget distributions may not align with the needs of different communities. \[Write about these two:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186789/ , http://neighbourhoodchange.ca/documents/2016/05/walks-etal-2016-income-inequality-toronto-york-rp-238.pdf\]

By analyzing data from the City of Toronto's Capital Budget & Plan, as well as its Ward Profiles, this research finds disparities in per capita funding among the 25 wards. The findings indicate that higher-income wards tend to receive more funding per capita than lower-income wards.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec-data} describes the data sources and methodology used in the analysis. Section \ref{sec-results} presents the results, highlighting key findings. Section \ref{sec-discussion} discussed the implications of the findings as well as limitations and recommendations for next steps.

## Data Sources

This research utilized two primary datasets provided by the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal.

1.  Capital Budget & Plan By Ward (2022-2031): \\ This dataset contains the approved capital budget and plan for each of Toronto's 25 wards over a ten-year period from 2022 to 2031. It includes funding allocations for various programs such as Children's Services, Parks, Foresty & Recreation, Transportation Services, and others. The data provides a detailed breakdown of how much funding each ward is set to receive for specific projects and services.

2.  Ward Profiles (2021): \\ This dataset provides comprehensive socioeconomic information for each ward based on the 2021 census. It was filtered to remain the variables which were most useful for this research. These are: Total Population, Median Household Income, Prevalence of Low Income Households, Educational Attainment, Immigration Status, Visible Minority Population. \[may need to include others, depends on what I decide to go with in the end.\]
